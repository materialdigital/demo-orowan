# demo-orowan

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook demonstrator that is based on a ontological framework. This framework is structured around the Platform MaterialDigital Core Ontology (PMDco), Tensile Test Ontology (TTO), and Precipitate Geometry Ontology (PGO).
This approach allows for a nuanced exploration and demonstration of the Orowan correlation in materials science. This example is provided by the PMD core team.
